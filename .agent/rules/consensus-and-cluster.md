# Consensus and cluster membership

Rules for `src/FastCache/Consensus/` and `src/FastCache/Cluster/`: Raft itself,
the LAN discovery beacon and its pre-shared-key handshake, the replicated cluster
configuration, and the admin verbs that change it.

Read this before touching `RaftNode`, `RaftLog`, `RaftDriver`, `RaftWire`,
`RaftPeerTransport`/`RaftPeerServer`, `DiscoveryService`, `PeerDirectory`,
`ClusterState`/`ClusterStateMachine` or `MembershipPolicy` — and before adding a
verb to the cluster-admin surface.

Every rule below has already been a bug.

## Discovery and the pre-shared key

- **A pre-shared key authenticates a handshake; it never travels in a beacon.**
  Discovery broadcasts what a node *is* -- cluster, id, Raft endpoint -- and nothing
  derived from the key, because a broadcast reaches every listener on the segment
  and anything key-derived in one hands them what they need to join. The key only
  ever appears inside an HMAC over a nonce the challenger chose. Five consequences,
  each of which some plausible simpler design gets wrong:
  - **The proof authenticates a `(node, endpoint)` PAIR, not the nonce alone.**
    Both are inside the MAC. Signing the nonce only would let anyone who observed
    one valid proof replay its tag with a *different* endpoint substituted --
    admitting a legitimate node id at an attacker's address. An admitted node is
    assigned compile jobs and returns objects cached fleet-wide, so that is object
    injection into everybody's build. Verified by removing the endpoint from the
    MAC and watching exactly the one case that asserts it fail.
  - **A proof is only ever an answer to a challenge THIS node issued**, and the
    nonce is spent whatever the outcome. An unsolicited proof is refused *even when
    it carries the real key*: it answers a nonce nobody here chose, and accepting
    one would make the nonce -- and therefore the replay protection -- pointless.
  - **A peer that moves loses its authenticated bit.** The bit is a property of the
    node *at an endpoint*, not of the node, because that is what the proof covered.
    Carrying it across a change would admit an address nobody proved.
  - **The pending-challenge table is one entry per node, with a lifetime.** A
    beacon is unauthenticated by construction, so anything on the segment can
    provoke a challenge -- a table that grew per datagram would be a
    memory-exhaustion hole reachable without holding the key, which is the same
    shape as the pre-auth payload cap on the `0xFC` port.
  - **Discovery never changes membership.** It answers who proved the key and where
    they answer; a caller proposes. Admitting a node is a Raft decision only a
    leader may make, and a layer that proposed directly would have every node on
    the segment proposing the same change at once.
- **A cluster id is routing, not authentication, and saying so keeps it honest.**
  It is plain text in every beacon, so treating it as a credential would be the
  mistake. What it buys is that two unrelated fleets on one segment ignore each
  other -- before a challenge is issued, and again before one is answered -- which
  holds even when somebody shares a key across fleets, which they should not.
- **SHA-256 is implemented here because OpenSSL is optional and authentication is
  not.** `FASTCACHED_ENABLE_TLS` is off by default, so a cluster that could only
  authenticate its members when TLS happened to be compiled in would silently
  accept anybody in the common configuration. `Core/Compression` reaches for a
  library because a codec is large and its output need only round-trip; a MAC is
  small and its output has to be *identical* on every machine that checks it. An
  existing published algorithm, for the reason `MurmurHash3` records -- conformance
  is checkable against FIPS 180-4 and RFC 4231, and a local construction would have
  nothing to check against. Three things it carries:
  - **`ConstantTimeEquals` for every MAC compared against an untrusted value.**
    `memcmp` stops at the first difference, so its timing reveals how many leading
    bytes a guess got right and lets an attacker who can retry recover a tag byte at
    a time instead of guessing all 32.
  - **The padding sweep, not just `"abc"`.** The rule has two branches -- the length
    fits this block or forces another -- and the boundary is where a hand-written
    implementation goes wrong; a single vector never reaches it.
  - **A miscounted test vector accuses the wrong code.** Both long-key RFC 4231
    cases were hand-typed as hex runs and both were wrong (49 bytes for 50, 120 for
    131), which reads exactly like an implementation failure. They are constructed
    programmatically now.
- **A datagram double delivers a broadcast to the sender too, and loses only what
  it is told to.** `DatagramBus` mirrors what a real broadcast does, which is
  precisely the case `PeerDirectory` must ignore -- a double that spared the sender
  would hide the bug where a lone node records its own beacon and proposes a
  membership change to admit itself. Loss is scripted per destination rather than
  random: a random rate fails occasionally for reasons nobody can reproduce, and
  what discovery must survive is a specific peer going quiet. And the seam has a
  **real** implementation exercised by a smoke case, because an interface with only
  a fake behind it is an interface nobody has checked -- `OpenUdpSocket` returned
  null on Windows until it called `Detail::EnsureNetworkInitialised`, and no fake
  would ever have shown that.

## The replicated cluster configuration

- **A cluster setting that nothing can change at runtime is a log entry pretending to
  be configuration.** The replicated log carried settings, applied them, snapshotted
  them and replicated them — and no surface anywhere said "set `upstream` to this", so
  the only way to configure a fleet was still `--upstream` on every machine, which is
  the file-editing the log exists to replace. `Op::ClusterStatus` / `ClusterSet` /
  `ClusterForget` on the scheduler's port close that, and four things about their
  shape are load-bearing:
  - **They go through the same `Gate()` as the dispatch verbs, the READ included.** A
    follower's copy of the state is valid and merely older, so `ClusterStatus` could
    have been answered anywhere; one rule for the whole surface is what makes "a verb
    added without the gate" impossible, and it sends an operator to the node they
    would need anyway to change anything. The refusal for a non-member is not about
    capacity here: a stranger who could set `upstream` would point the whole fleet's
    cache at a host of their choosing.
  - **`NoCluster` is distinct from `NotLeader`, because the operator does something
    different.** `NotLeader` names somewhere else to ask; `NoCluster` says the
    question does not apply here at all — a single node started without `--node-id`
    leads itself and has no replicated state. Answering the second with the first
    sends somebody looking for a node that does not exist.
  - **The consensus-to-wire refusal mapping is a table with one row per
    `ConsensusErrorCode`, `static_assert`ed on its length.** A `switch` here and a
    `switch` somewhere else drift, and a refusal reported under the wrong code sends
    an operator to fix something that was never wrong. The three peer-wire decode
    codes cannot arise from a *local* proposal — no bytes are involved — so they map
    to the generic refusal rather than to a claim about what happened.
  - **The reply says "accepted", never "committed".** A leader appends the entry and
    answers; whether a majority has taken it is not something it knows yet, and a
    tool that said otherwise would be the one kind of report that must not be wrong.
    `IClusterAdmin` is the seam the scheduler reaches all of this through, which is
    what lets the whole verb surface be tested against a fake that records what it was
    asked to propose, with no log, no threads and no cluster.

- **Absent is not empty, and a membership proposal is where that pays.**
  `Cluster::DesiredMember` carries `std::optional<std::string> schedulerEndpoint`
  while `ClusterMember` carries a plain string, and the difference is load-bearing in
  one direction only. `AddMember` applies **wholesale** — a re-proposal that omitted a
  field would clear it — which is right when the proposer knows the member has no
  scheduler surface, and destructive when it simply never knew. Discovery is always
  the second case: it proves where a peer answers *consensus*, because that is what
  the MAC covered, and learns nothing about the port clients speak to since nobody
  dials it. So a node says `""` about itself and `nullopt` about a peer, and only the
  first is an assertion. Collapsing the two would have every follower's discovery loop
  clear the leader's redirect address the moment it noticed the leader — a fleet whose
  redirects break on a timer, self-healing at the next election and therefore
  intermittent.

## Raft

- **Consensus had never been RUN, and five defects were waiting where no unit test
  could reach them.** `RaftNode`, `RaftLog`, `RaftDriver` and `RaftClusterHarness`
  are exhaustively tested against a simulated cluster in one process — which is the
  right place for the algorithm's rules, since a scripted partition is not something
  three real processes can be made to reproduce. What that cannot reach is the wire,
  the transport, the timers and the operator's own command line all having their
  first say at once, and `scripts/cluster-e2e.sh` is what does. It found, in order:
  - **`SyncRun` cannot drive a reactor.** It resumes a coroutine exactly once and
    throws when the coroutine is still suspended, so `SyncRun(driver->Run(&reactor))`
    aborted the process the moment `RaftDriver::Run` awaited `SleepUntil`. The
    correct spelling is the one `ReactorServerLoop` already uses: submit the loop as
    a `DetachedTask` and call `reactor.Run()`.
  - **A blocking listener serves one peer and never accepts another.** With
    `BlockingSocket`, every `co_await` inside `RaftPeerServer` completes
    synchronously, so its per-connection `DetachedTask` — written detached precisely
    so several peers can be read at once — runs to completion inline and the accept
    loop never reaches its next iteration. In a three-node cluster each node reads
    from exactly one of its two peers. Nothing crashes and nothing logs a fault; the
    fleet simply never becomes ready. Hence `Net/PlatformListener.hpp`, and hence the
    two loops sharing one reactor rather than owning a thread each.
  - **`RaftPeerTransport::Start()` was called by nobody.** The outbound side owned a
    thread per peer then, started on request, so every node came up, listened,
    ticked its own timers and sent *nothing*. Three nodes sat at `undecided` forever
    with no error anywhere — the exact shape of failure this list keeps recording,
    and invisible to a single-node cluster, which elects itself with no messages at
    all.
  - **A leader's ADDRESS arrives after its role does.** A node announces its own
    record once elected, so the entry carrying its scheduler endpoint commits
    strictly after the role change that provoked it. Publishing only on a role change
    left every follower answering `NotLeader` with nothing for the rest of the term —
    which a client cannot tell from an election in progress and answers by compiling
    locally, every time. `ConsensusTier::Republish` therefore runs on a state change
    as well, and suppresses only an answer that has genuinely not moved.
  - **A loop that parks on a deadline it read cannot be told the deadline moved.**
    `RaftDriver::Run` reads `NextDeadline()` and hands the coroutine to the
    reactor's timer wheel, and `SleepUntil` has no cancellation -- while `Receive`,
    arriving from a peer-reader coroutine on that same reactor, can move that
    deadline *earlier*. The case that matters is a candidate winning: its deadline
    goes from an election deadline up to `electionTimeoutMax` away to a heartbeat
    deadline one interval away. The new leader's first heartbeat still goes out
    immediately (`BecomeLeader` sends it), so the cluster looks elected; its
    **second** is then late by most of an election timeout, the follower that drew
    the shortest randomized timeout elects itself,
    and the next leader repeats it. Measured on three real nodes: **nine role
    changes in twelve seconds** with nothing else wrong, against two after the fix
    -- and a `Linux-clang-release` CI failure in which `cluster-e2e` found exactly
    one leader, counted exactly one, and then found a *second* one two assertions
    later. The sleep is bounded by the heartbeat interval now, which is the same
    answer `BlockingListener::SetTimeouts` gives to the same shape of problem: a
    wait nothing can interrupt is bounded rather than left to be woken. It costs a
    leader nothing (it already wakes at that cadence) and a follower a few empty
    wake-ups per election timeout. Three things worth keeping:
    - **No single-threaded test can see it, which is why it is on this list.**
      `RaftDriver_test` and `RaftClusterHarness` both advance a node by calling
      `Tick` directly, so the deadline the loop is *sleeping on* does not exist in
      either. The regression case therefore drives `Run` on a `TestReactor` and
      delivers the winning vote through `Receive` while the loop is parked --
      verified by removing the bound and watching that one case, and only it, fail.
    - **A single poll passes against leadership that never settles.** A cluster
      re-electing on a timer has exactly one leader at almost every instant; two
      only in the window where a deposed leader has not yet heard from its
      successor. `cluster-e2e` asked once, which is how this reached CI as an
      unrelated-looking failure. It now holds the question open for three seconds
      and requires the same node to answer throughout.
    - **The fixture dumps every node's log on any failure**, not only when no
      leader appears. A consensus defect that reproduces once in five runs is
      diagnosable from the logs or not at all, and cleanup deletes them.

  Two further consequences are worth stating on their own. **`RaftDriver` holds a
  mutex now**, because the node is advanced from three routes by construction — the
  timer loop, a peer reader, and whatever proposes a configuration change — and
  `RaftNode` has no synchronization of its own, which is exactly what makes it
  testable. And **the reactor is stopped by the loops themselves, when the second of
  them finishes**, because `IReactor::Run` returns with its timer heap and its parked
  work exactly where they were: a loop still suspended at that moment is a coroutine
  frame nobody ever resumes and nobody ever frees. For the same reason
  `RaftPeerServer::Shutdown` closes the connections it accepted and not only its
  listener.

- **A snapshot is durable before it is acknowledged, and its configuration travels
  with it.** `IRaftStorage` had `SaveState` and `SaveLog` and nothing else, so
  `RaftLog::Compact`'s stated precondition — the caller has made a snapshot through
  `through` durable first — could not be satisfied by any API in the tree. Two
  consequences, and neither fails loudly. A follower that answers `InstallSnapshot`
  at index N without persisting it **retracts that acknowledgement on restart**,
  after a leader may already have counted it towards commitment: Leader
  Completeness, lost to a write nobody made. And a leader that compacted and
  restarted came back with an *empty* `_snapshotState`, so the next follower far
  enough behind was shipped an empty snapshot **as though it were state**. Hence
  `IRaftStorage::SaveSnapshot`, the snapshot on `RecoveredState`, and
  `RaftOutput::saveSnapshot` — carried through the output channel rather than
  written by whoever asked for the compaction, for exactly the reason `persist`
  and `persistLog` are: it is a durability write that has to be ordered against
  the messages, and only the driver can order it. Consequences that are each
  load-bearing:
  - **The write order is snapshot-then-trim, and the crash window it leaves is
    the reason that order is right.** A crash between them leaves a durable
    snapshot beside a log that still holds the entries it covers, which
    `RaftNode`'s constructor reconciles by compacting to the boundary. The
    opposite order leaves a log missing committed entries and no snapshot to
    replace them, which nothing can repair. That reconciliation is also what lets
    a store which never trims its log be merely wasteful rather than wrong.
  - **A trimmed log cannot be positional, so each record carries its own index.**
    `FileRaftStorage` derived an entry's index from its position in the file,
    which has no answer once a prefix is gone — and in the crash window above it
    has a *wrong* answer, silently: entry 8 recovers as entry 1, and every index
    in the store is off by the length of the discarded prefix. The degenerate case
    needs the snapshot as well: a log trimmed to nothing has no record left to
    state where it resumes, and without that the next append is refused as a gap
    forever.
  - **The configuration is part of the snapshot, because compaction is precisely
    what leaves nothing to re-derive it from.** `RefreshConfiguration` scans the
    log for the newest `Configuration` entry and falls back when it finds none —
    and the fall-back was the **bootstrap** member set. So a node that took part in
    a membership change and then compacted past it forgot that change, silently,
    and only after a restart: `Quorum()` then counts a majority of the wrong set.
    The scan also ran to index 1 rather than stopping at the log's own first index,
    which is what made "no entry" the answer for a log that merely no longer holds
    one.
  - **`HasUncommittedConfiguration()` is `LatestConfigurationIndex() > _commitIndex`,
    derived rather than scanned for separately.** They are the same question, and
    two backward scans answering it independently are two places for the rule to
    drift.
- **A seeded draw must be the same on every platform, or a seeded harness is not
  reproducible.** `std::mt19937_64` is specified bit-for-bit by the standard;
  `std::uniform_int_distribution` is **not** — how it reduces the engine's output
  to a range is the implementation's business, and libstdc++ and libc++ do it
  differently. `SystemRandomSource`'s fixed-seed constructor exists so a failure
  can be replayed, and `RaftClusterHarness` seeds one per node so a whole cluster's
  adversarial schedule is reproducible; both promises held only within one standard
  library. The harness therefore ran a **different** schedule on macOS than on
  Linux and Windows, and three cluster cases failed there and nowhere else — in CI,
  at `-O3`, where nothing local reproduces it. `UniformInRange` now does the range
  reduction itself, and a golden vector pins it. The same argument `Core/MurmurHash3`
  makes about its digest and `PathCanon::AsciiLower` about locale: a value this
  codebase relies on being identical everywhere cannot come from something allowed
  to vary. Two consequences:
  - **It takes the HIGH bits of the engine draw, and that is not a detail.**
    Masking the low bits is the shorter spelling and was the first version. Mersenne
    Twister seeded with *adjacent* values produces correlated low-order output for
    its first draws, and the harness seeds its nodes `base + 0`, `base + 1`, … — so
    five nodes drew near-identical first election timeouts, campaigned together and
    split the vote, round after round. Election jitter exists precisely to
    decorrelate those draws; sourcing it from the one part of the output that is
    correlated across neighbouring seeds defeats the mechanism it feeds.
  - **The three tests it was masking were a real defect, not bad luck.** See the
    next entry — which is the reason a harness like this is worth its cost at all.
- **Pre-vote asks whether a LEADER is live, so it must not be answered from this
  node's own election timer.** `OnPreVote` refused when `now < _electionDeadline`,
  and that deadline is re-armed when the node *starts its own pre-vote round*. So a
  node that had just begun campaigning answered "yes, I heard from a leader
  recently" for a full timeout and refused every peer that timed out alongside it —
  which is the ordinary case in a cluster whose nodes are meant to race. Nothing
  fails and nothing is unsafe: a five-node cluster simply took some **forty**
  election rounds to elect anybody where one should do, which reads as a livelock
  in a cluster test and is invisible to a unit test that only ever has one
  candidate. Measured at 994 harness steps before and 20–23 after. `_lastLeaderContact`
  is now its own field, set only where a leader actually spoke — an accepted
  AppendEntries or InstallSnapshot — through `NoteLeaderContact`, while standing for
  election and granting a vote still arm the timer alone. The window is
  `electionTimeoutMin` rather than the node's own randomized deadline, because "is
  there a live leader" is a fact about the cluster that every node should answer
  the same way at the same instant. Both halves are tested: a campaigning node
  still grants, and a node that has just heard from a leader still refuses —
  losing the second while fixing the first would trade a slow election for the
  disruption pre-vote exists to prevent. The residual, unchanged by this and
  recorded deliberately: a **leader** never hears from a leader, so its own
  `_lastLeaderContact` ages out and it grants a challenger's pre-vote — exactly as
  it did before, since a leader arms no election timer either. Refusing there is
  CheckQuorum or a leader lease, which `RaftCluster_test` already names as a
  separate mechanism and which nothing here needs yet.
- **A round-trip test that omits a message type omits the arm most likely to be
  wrong.** Five of `RaftWire`'s eight encoder arms are near-copies of another —
  PreVote of RequestVote, `InstallSnapshotResponse` of `AppendEntriesResponse` —
  and the mistake copying invites is a transposed field index. The four types added
  with pre-vote and snapshots had **no positive round trip at all**, so an arm
  writing `lastIncludedTerm` where `lastIncludedIndex` belongs passed the entire
  suite; verified by making that transposition and watching only the new cases
  fail. The replacement is one exemplar per `MessageTable` row with **every field a
  different value** — two fields sharing a value would let the transposition
  through — compared whole through `operator==` rather than field by field, since
  field-by-field checks are what the copied arms already survived. A row without an
  exemplar fails the case rather than going quietly untested, and the enum sweep is
  kept separate precisely so the exemplars' values can stay distinct.
## Open work

- **[#103](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/103)** — a
  leader grants a challenger's pre-vote, because a leader never hears from a
  leader and its `_lastLeaderContact` ages out. This is the residual argued at
  the end of the pre-vote rule above; closing it is CheckQuorum or a leader lease.
- **[#97](https://github.com/LASTRADA-Software/fastcached/issues/97)** — a node
  admitted by discovery joins the cluster's *state* but not its *quorum*:
  `RaftNode::ProposeMembership` still takes ids alone, and
  `RaftPeerTransport`'s peer list is fixed at construction.
