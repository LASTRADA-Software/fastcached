## Profiling with Tracy

[Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) instrumentation is **opt-in and
zero-cost when off**: it is gated behind the `TRACY_ENABLE` CMake option
(default `OFF`). When off, no Tracy header is included, nothing is linked, and
every profiling macro in `FastCache/Core/Profiling.hpp` collapses to
`(void) 0` — the default `clang-debug`/`clang-release` binaries are unchanged
and link zero Tracy symbols.

### Building the profiling daemon

```sh
cmake --preset clang-tracy        # RelWithDebInfo, TRACY_ENABLE=ON, TRACY_ON_DEMAND=ON
cmake --build --preset clang-tracy
# -> out/build/clang-tracy/target/fastcached
```

`TRACY_ON_DEMAND=ON` means the daemon buffers nothing until a profiler
connects, so it is safe to leave running; you only pay the cost while
capturing.

### Adding zones

Instrument code through the wrapper macros, never Tracy directly:

```cpp
#include <FastCache/Core/Profiling.hpp>

FC_ZONE_SCOPED;                         // zone named by source location
FC_ZONE_SCOPED_N("CacheEngine::Get");   // zone with a compile-time literal name
FC_FRAME_MARK;                          // one logical request/frame boundary
FC_THREAD_NAME("fc-worker-0");          // name the calling OS thread
FC_PLOT("lru.bytesUsed", value);        // scalar timeline (value is numeric)
```

**Coroutine constraint (must be observed):** `FC_ZONE_SCOPED*` declares a
thread-local stack-RAII guard and **must not straddle a `co_await`** — under the
reactor model the await resumes on a later frame and the guard's destructor
would corrupt Tracy's per-thread zone stack. Place zones only in synchronous
leaf functions or in `{ }` blocks containing no `co_await`. `FC_FRAME_MARK` is a
stackless timeline event and is safe anywhere, including inside coroutine loops.
Macro arguments must be free of side-effects the program relies on (when Tracy
is off they are discarded unevaluated). `FC_ZONE_SCOPED_N` requires a
compile-time string literal; for a runtime label, annotate the current zone with
`FC_ZONE_NAME(ptr, len)` / `FC_ZONE_TEXT(ptr, len)` instead.

### Analyzing a capture

Build a Tracy viewer once (sources are fetched into the build tree under
`out/build/clang-tracy/_deps/tracy-src/`), or grab a prebuilt **v0.11.x** viewer
from the Tracy releases — the client and viewer protocol is version-locked.

```sh
# Interactive GUI (needs glfw/freetype/capstone/gtk3/dbus dev packages):
cmake -S out/build/clang-tracy/_deps/tracy-src/profiler -B /tmp/tracy-gui -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /tmp/tracy-gui -j        # -> /tmp/tracy-gui/tracy-profiler

# Headless capture (no GUI deps; writes a .tracy file to open later):
cmake -S out/build/clang-tracy/_deps/tracy-src/capture -B /tmp/tracy-cap -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build /tmp/tracy-cap -j        # -> /tmp/tracy-cap/tracy-capture
```

Workflow — the client listens on TCP **8086**:

1. Start the daemon: `./out/build/clang-tracy/target/fastcached --bind 127.0.0.1`.
2. Connect the profiler (GUI **Connect**, or `tracy-capture -o out.tracy -a 127.0.0.1`).
   On-demand mode records only from the moment of connection, so connect **before**
   driving load.
3. Drive traffic through the hot path, e.g.
   `memtier_benchmark -s 127.0.0.1 -p 6674 -P memcache_text --ratio=1:4 -n 50000`,
   `redis-benchmark -p 6674 -t set,get -n 100000`, or a quick
   `printf 'set foo 0 0 3\r\nbar\r\nget foo\r\nquit\r\n' | nc 127.0.0.1 6674`.

What the instrumentation surfaces: thread rows named `fastcached-main` /
`fc-worker-N` / `fc-reactor`; one frame per request; the nested zone breakdown
`socket.read → LineReader.TryExtractLine → memcached.Handle*.dispatch →
CacheEngine::* → ShardedStorage::* → LruStorage::* / EvictToFit → socket.write`;
and the `lru.bytesUsed` plot for memory pressure. Use the **Statistics** window
sorted by self-time to find hotspots; a gap between a `ShardedStorage::*` zone
and its inner `LruStorage::*` zone is shard-mutex wait time.
